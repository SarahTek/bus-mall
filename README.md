# Lab: BusMall

## Author = Sarah Teklemariam
## Collaborator = Martha

This project was about creating a survey according to the users product votes and views.

The BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest.

The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data in a CHART.


I collaborated with Martha. This was a fun project.
